To get started you might want to install the following:

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for vector drawing
- [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/fusion-360/overview) for modelling - free for personal use
- [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle) for sending g-code instructions to the CNC
